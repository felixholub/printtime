# PRINTTIME
This is a simple program which prints time and date in Stata. It will later be extended to allow for more customization. This program works fine but this repo mainly serves to try out some things regarding Stata programing.

# Installation

In Stata, simply run
```
cap ado uninstall printtime
net install printtime, from(https://github.com/felixholub/printtime/raw/master/src/)
```
